                        <h3>Information about the study</h3>
                            <p>People often turn to chatbots to discuss stressful situations at work, relationship struggles, or to find coping strategies for emotional or mental health concerns. This study aims to understand users' experiences, motivations, and perceptions when using AI chatbots to address their emotional or social needs.</p>
                            <p>A wide variety of chatbots are used to support mental health, ranging from general-purpose ones like ChatGPT and Gemini to more specialized such as Pi.AI, Dot, Replika, or Wysa. We are interested in hearing about any experiences, whether you've used chatbots for casual conversations or more focused mental health support.</p>

                        <h4>Study Details</h4>
                            <p> This study involves a one-time interview where you will share your experiences with AI chatbots.
